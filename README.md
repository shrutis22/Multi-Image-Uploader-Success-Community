# Multi-Image-Uploader-Success-Community

Extension that lets you upload multiple files while answering on the Salesforce Success Community

The Salesforce Success Community does not provide us the provision to post multiple images in a single instance. It becomes really difficult and time consuming to select each photo one by one for a person who is answering the question. And if you are late, then the question is already answered. Hence it is very important to answer the questions as fast as possible. This extension helps you to upload multiple images together in fraction of seconds.

It allows to upload more than one image at a time while answering on the Success Coummunity.

The Extension was created with just 
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Dropzone.js

This Extension is completely free! Use it at your own will. Feel free to add a citation to this GitHub Repo.

Also, if you have any queries, improvisations or suggestions, feel free to let me know :)
